## INSPIRATION

**Crafting Dreams: Empowering India's Unsung Artisans:**

"Imagine a remote village in India, where talented artisans pour their heart and soul into creating exquisite handcrafted treasures. These artisans, often hidden from the world, possess skills passed down through generations, yet their artistry remains undiscovered. In this slide, we embark on a journey of empathy, shedding light on the untold stories of these craftsmen, their struggles, aspirations, and the sheer magic they create with their hands. Join us as we unveil a platform that not only celebrates their craftsmanship but also brings their dreams to life in the digital age."



## What it Does !!

Our platform serves as an online marketplace and vibrant artistic community, bridging the gap between artists, vendors, and art enthusiasts. It is designed to offer a seamless space where artists and vendors can showcase their creations, share their artistic journeys, and connect with a diverse audience of art lovers.


 An exciting feature we proudly introduce is AR visualization, allowing buyers to virtually place artworks and products in their own spaces for a more immersive shopping experience.

 Explore our website to discover a diverse collection of locally made goods, ranging from traditional crafts to contemporary designs.Join us on AR-tifacts and become a part of the movement that promotes local entrepreneurship, preserves cultural heritage, and fosters economic growth within your community. Experience the pride of owning unique, locally crafted artifacts while making a positive impact on the lives of talented artisans.
## ðŸ”§ How We Build  

We designed a website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript for Frontend Developemnt and Flask for Backend connectivity.

We used Mobile Viewer + WEBXR and Glitch for the the 3D  model building and rendering.


We have used Mongo DB atlas for the our database connectivity for our vendor registration form. The connection string from MongoDB cluster is used in the server.js file to ensure connection.
## Challenges We Ran Into ðŸ’€


**Brainstorming:** Since we are working on the project of AR, it takes out team a while to think a while how to implemnent the 3D model in our Website and how to create the 3D model of the object.

**Building:** It is also a challenging Hackathon that we need to work in new areas which we were unfamiliar with, such as handling 3D model, making and customizing 3D models and applying it for backend to the website to build a good project. Handling both backend and frontend at the same time within a weekend is also a big challenge for us.
## ðŸš€ How we have used Github in our project? ðŸš€

**Github Pages** we deployed our website at http://artists.devsprojects.us using Render and Glitch. It was really simple to deploy our site through Render and we are planning to use this feature in future hackathons.

**Push and Pull** : We used Github for making out task separated and handy for all of us working simiultaneously. 
## Future Scope ðŸ”­

**Customization:** Users can utilize AR to customise options,-colors, or sizes, enhancing their unique shopping experience.

 Future mobiles having the LiDAR sensor, then we will able to set the fixed size of the product which will show in AR .
 
Our software can also useful to the vendors who have the showroom, for efficient utilization of space and reduce prototyping cost.
Can make a data pipeline which take 3d model and with LiDAR dataset it verify and show to the
